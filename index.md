## Welcome to the Next Raise pledge

ðŸ›  Disclaimer: This whole thing is in a super early stage, you can help if you'd like.

### What is the pledge

It's about promising that you'll donate the amount of your next salary raise in the first month after you get the raise.

It's a way of sharing your growth and success with others. It is giving a substantial gift, in a way that does not require any long-term commitment.

```markdown
Based on an example

1. You make *10k* a month and you receive a raise of *2k*, effective from March
2. So in February you get *10k* on your bank account
3. And in March you get *12k* on your bank account
4. In March you wire 2k to the charity of your choice, you have 10k for own expenses as before
6. In April you get 12k on your bank account, and have 12k for own expenses ðŸ’°
7. See you upon your next raise, fingers crossed for 14k!
```

### Why do we do it?

We acknowledge that in the world of IT, we are lucky to have a demanding but well-paid jobs where salary raise is frequent. We see that there is a large salary gap between IT and some other sectors and want to share our success. 

### How can I help?

You can simply wire the money to an organisation that needs it ðŸ’¸ 

But you can also help by contributing to expanding this open-source operation. So far there are a few ideas what we can do to grow this to have a bigger impact:
- [ ] Figure out a way we can use GitHub to improve collaboration on this project.
- [ ] Figure out a neat way for people to be able to commit to the pledge and somehow write their name on the wall, create a social proof and a snowball effect.
- [ ] Figure out a way we can market this nicely in social media (DYI profile picture sticker?).
- [ ] Create a list of verified charities that are worth donating to.
