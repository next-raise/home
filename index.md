## Welcome to the Next Raise pledge

🛠 Disclaimer: This whole thing is in a super early stage, you can help if you'd like. 

### What is the pledge

Just a promise that we will donate the amount of our next salary raise in the first month after we get the raise. That's all.

```markdown
Based on an example

1. I make 10k a month and I receive a raise of 2k, effective from March
2. So in February I get 10k on my bank account, as usual.
3. And in March I will get 12k on my bank account
4. So in March I will keep the usual 10k and wire the additional 2k to the charity of my choice.
6. In April I get 12k again, and I keep the whole 12k for my own expenses💰
7. If I'm lucky to get another raise in the future, I do the same.
```

### Why do we do it?

💙 We acknowledge that by being in the world of IT, we are lucky to have a demanding, but well-paid jobs, where salary raise is frequent. 

🛠 We see that there is a large salary gap between IT and some other sectors and want to share our success. 

⏳ The pledge is a way of sharing our growth and success with others. It is giving a substantial gift just by delaying the reward, not taking it away from oneself.


### How can I help?

You can simply wire the money to an organisation that needs it 💸  Maybe post on social media and link to this site?

But you can also help by contributing to expanding this open-source operation. So far there are a few ideas what we can do to grow this to have a bigger impact:
- [ ] Figure out a way we can use GitHub to improve collaboration on this project.
- [ ] Figure out a neat way for people to be able to commit to the pledge and somehow _write their name on the wall_, create a social proof and a snowball effect.
- [ ] Figure out a way we can market this nicely in social media (profile picture sticker generator?).
- [ ] Create a list of verified charities that are worth donating to in some countries.
